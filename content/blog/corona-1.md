Friends and supporters of DevFest Toulouse,

The current events surrounding the coronavirus are in all acts and minds.

To date, the DevFest Toulouse is scheduled for November 5th and 6th, that is to say in **more than 6 months**. We, organizers, hope that the situation will allow the organization **without postponement** or cancellation . 

However, we believe that the impacts of the sanitary barrier rules bring constraints for all of us. It is these rules that must hold your full attention.

This is why, even if a safe distance is possible, **we have decided to postpone the opening of the sponsoring offers, the CFP, and the ticketing for our 2020 edition**. Focus on your families and concentrate on following the guidelines to make the sanitary barriers most effective. The DevFest Toulouse 2020 can wait. We'll know how to work harder when the calm is back. **This message is valid for the opening of the sponsorship offers, the opening of the CFP and the opening of the ticketing**.

We will get back to you as soon as possible.

Until then, stay tuned:
